# Lab | SQL Intro

In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. You can follow the steps listed here to get the data locally: [Sakila sample database - installation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html). You can work with two sql query files - `sakila-schema.sql` (creates the schema) + `sakila-data.sql` which inserts the data.

The ERD is pictured below - not all tables are shown, but many of the key fields you will be using are visible:
